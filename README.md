<h2>What is the Integrated Value Network (IVN)?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2016/m-16-17.pdf">OMB A-123, Management's Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control:</a> "Federal leaders and managers are responsible for...a governance structure defined through...sources, including laws...Executive directives and Agency policies."</p>

<p>The Integrated Value Network (IVN) is an attempt to represent the US Federal Agency governance structure as a neural network.
</p>
<p>
This network is not a product, but a logical artifact of White House policy and US Federal law.
</p>
<p>
The intent of the IVN project is to refine this network, and help policymakers apply it to communicate and create strategy with greater systemic effects.
